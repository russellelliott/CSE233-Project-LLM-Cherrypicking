The brackets are `0`, `10000`, `40000`, `80000`, and `150000`. The corresponding tax rates are `0%`, `10%`, `20%`, `30%`, and `40%`.\n\n2. **Tax Calculation**: The script calculates the tax by iterating through the brackets. For each bracket, it checks if the income is greater than the bracket's upper limit. If it is, it calculates the tax for that bracket and adds it to the total tax. If the income falls within a bracket, it calculates the tax for that portion of the income and breaks out of the loop.\n\n3. **Default Case**: If the income exceeds the highest bracket, the script outputs a message indicating that there is no default case for income tax calculation.\n\n4. **Execution**: The script is executed with an income of `$150,000`.\n\n### How to Run the Script:\n1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `calculate_tax.sh`.\n2. Make the script executable:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x calculate_tax.sh\n   ```\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   ./calculate_tax.sh\n   ```\n\n### Output:\nFor an income of `$150,000`, the script will output:\n```\nIncome tax for income 150000 is: 45000\n```\n\nIf the income were outside the predefined brackets, it would output:\n```\nNo default case for income tax calculation for income: <income>\n```\n\nThis script is designed to be clear, concise, and specific to the task at hand."

A `case` statement then checks the value of this argument. If the argument is 1 through 6, the corresponding weekday name is echoed to standard output. If the argument doesn't match any of the cases from 1-6, the final `*)` case triggers, and a message \"No default case to get the weekday name.\" is output.\n\nThe script then calls the `weekday_name` function with the argument `7`.

We start by declaring the script as a bash script with the shebang `#!/bin/bash`.\n\n2. We define the `process_command` function that takes one argument:\n   - The function uses a `case` statement to match the argument (`$1`) against different patterns\n   - Each valid command (\"start\", \"stop\", \"restart\") has its own case with a corresponding message\n   - The `return 0` statements indicate successful execution\n   - The `*` case matches any unrecognized command and returns 1 to indicate an error\n\n3. We call the function with the argument \"pause\": `process_command \"pause\"`\n\n4. After the function call, we check the exit status using `$?` in an if statement:\n   - `$?` contains the return value of the last executed command\n   - The if statement checks if the exit status equals 1\n   - If true, it prints the message about no default case\n\nIn the output, we see \"No default case for the command.\" because:\n- \"pause\" doesn't match any of the defined commands in the case statement\n- The function returns 1 through the `*` case\n- The if statement detects the exit status of 1 and prints the message\n\nYou can test other commands by modifying the argument in the function call:\n- `process_command \"start\"` would output \"Starting the system.\"\n- `process_command \"stop\"` would output \"Stopping the system.\"\n- `process_command \"restart\"` would output \"Restarting the system.\"\n- Any other argument would trigger the \"No default case\" message",

The function is called with the argument `\"pause\"`, which does not match any of the defined patterns.\n4. After the function call, the script checks the exit status of the last command using `$?`.

Associative arrays allow you to store key-value pairs. In this case, the keys are item names (strings), and the values are the corresponding discount rates (also strings, representing decimal percentages).\n    *   Discount rates are defined for \"electronics\" (10%) and \"books\" (5%).\n    *   `if [[ ${discounts[\"$item\"]} ]]`:  Checks if a discount rate exists for the given `item` in the `discounts` array.  This is a crucial check to avoid errors when trying to access a non-existent key.\n    *   If a discount exists:\n        *   `local discount_rate=${discounts[\"$item\"]}`: Retrieves the discount rate from the array.\n        *   `local discount_amount=$(echo \"$price * $discount_rate\" | bc)`: Calculates the discount amount.  The `bc` command is used for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, which is essential when dealing with floating-point numbers in bash.\n        *   `local discounted_price=$(echo \"$price - $discount_amount\" | bc)`: Calculates the discounted price.\n        *   The function then prints the item name, original price, discount rate, discount amount, and discounted price.\n    *   `else`: If no discount exists for the item:\n        *   Prints a message indicating that no default discount is available.\n3.  **Example Usage:**\n    *   The script calls the `calculate_discount` function with three examples: \"electronics\", \"books\", and \"clothes\".\n    *   The calls to \"electronics\" and \"books\" will demonstrate the discount calculation.\n    *   The call to \"clothes\" will trigger the \"No default discount available\" message because no discount is defined for that item in the `discounts` array.\n\nTo execute this script:\n\n1.

We define the `get_pet_sound` function, which takes a single argument `$1`, the pet type.\n2. We use a `case` statement to check if the pet type matches one of the predefined types: \"dog\", \"cat\", and \"bird\". If a match is found, the corresponding sound is echoed and the function returns normally.\n3. If the pet type is not recognized, the `*)` pattern matches and the function echoes an error message and returns an error code (1) using the `return` statement.\n4. We test the function with a few examples, including a not-supported pet type (\"hamster\"), to demonstrate its behavior.\n\nTo execute this script, save it to a file (e.g., `pet_sounds.sh`), make the file executable with `chmod +x pet_sounds.sh`, and then run it with `./pet_sounds.sh`.",
                "gemini-2.0-flash": "```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Function to get the sound of a pet\nget_pet_sound() {\n  local pet_type=\"$1\"\n\n  case \"$pet_type\" in\n    \"dog\")\n      echo \"Woof!\"\n      return 0 # Success\n      ;;\n    \"cat\")\n      echo \"Meow!\"\n      return 0 # Success\n      ;;\n    \"bird\")\n      echo \"Tweet!\"\n      return 0 # Success\n      ;;\n    *)\n      echo \"Error: Unknown pet type: $pet_type\" >&2 # Send error to stderr\n      return 1 # Failure\n      ;;\n  esac\n}\n\n# Attempt to get the sound of a hamster\nif ! get_pet_sound \"hamster\"; then\n  echo \"No default case defined for pet sound.\"\nfi\n\n# Example usage with supported pet types\necho \"Dog sound: $(get_pet_sound \"dog\")\"\necho \"Cat sound: $(get_pet_sound \"cat\")\"\necho \"Bird sound: $(get_pet_sound \"bird\")\"\n\nexit 0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Shebang:** `#!/bin/bash` specifies the interpreter for the script (bash).\n2. **`get_pet_sound()` function:**\n   - Takes one argument: `pet_type`.\n   - Uses a `case` statement to match the `pet_type` against predefined values (\"dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\").\n   - For each matching pet type, it `echo`s the corresponding sound to standard output and returns a success code (0).\n   - The `*)`  is the default case. If `pet_type` doesn't match any of the predefined cases, it prints an error message to standard error (`>&2`) and returns a failure code (1).  Using standard error for error messages is good practice.\n3. **Hamster Example:**\n   - `if ! get_pet_sound \"hamster\"; then ... fi` : This calls the `get_pet_sound` function with \"hamster\" as the argument.  The `!` inverts the return code of the function. So, if `get_pet_sound` returns a non-zero exit code (meaning it failed, as it would for \"hamster\"), then the `then` block will be executed.\n   - `echo \"No default case defined for pet sound.\"` : This line is executed because \"hamster\" is not a defined pet type, the `get_pet_sound` function returns a failure code (1), and thus the `if` condition is met.\n4. **Example Usage with Supported Pets:**\n   - Shows how to call the function with valid pet types.  The `$(...)` syntax executes the function and captures its output, which is then inserted into the `echo` statement.\n5. **`exit 0`:**  Indicates that the script completed successfully.\n\n**How to run the script:**\n\n1. Save the code to a file, for example, `pet_sounds.sh`.\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x pet_sounds.sh`.\n3. Run the script: `./pet_sounds.sh`.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nError: Unknown pet type: hamster\nNo default case defined for pet sound.\nDog sound: Woof!\nCat sound: Meow!\nBird sound: Tweet!\n```\n\nThis output shows the error message from trying to get the hamster sound, the message indicating no default case, and then the correct sounds for the dog, cat, and bird.

First, we define the `categorize_age` function that takes one parameter.\n\n2. Inside the function, we use `local age=$1` to create a local variable that stores the first argument passed to the function.\n\n3. We use conditional statements to check the age ranges and echo the appropriate category:\n   - Ages 0-12 return \"child\"\n   - Ages 13-19 return \"teenager\"\n   - Ages 20-64 return \"adult\"\n   - Ages 65 and above return nothing (empty string)\n\n4.

This is where the script outputs a warning message:\n        *   The message alerts the user that there is no specific handling defined for the given payment method.\n        *   The message instructs the user to ensure a default case is added to handle the payment or handle the payment type appropriately.\n4.  **Example Usage:**\n    *   The script includes a few examples of how to call the `determine_payment` function with different payment methods, including one where the payment method is \"bitcoin\", one that exists \"credit\\_card\" and one that does not exist \"venmo\", \"bogus\\_payment\"\n5.  **Execution:**\n    *   To execute this script, save it to a file (e.g., `payment_script.sh`) and then run it from your terminal using the command: `bash payment_script.sh`.\n6.  **Local variables:** The `local` keyword limits the scope of the `payment_method` variable to the function, preventing variable name conflicts in other parts of the script.\n\nThis script will output messages indicating which payment method is being processed, and if it encounters a payment method that is not defined, it will print a warning.  The \"bitcoin\" case is explicitly included, and the warning message is generated only when an undefined payment method is used.\n",

The `season_of_the_year` function takes a single argument `$1`, which represents the month number (1-12).\n2. The function uses a `case` statement to determine the season based on the input month. The cases are:\n\t* January, February, and December (months 1, 2, and 12) are winter.\n\t* March, April, and May (months 3, 4, and 5) are spring.\n\t* June, July, and August (months 6, 7, and 8) are summer.\n\t* September, October, and November (months 9, 10, and 11) are autumn.\n3. The function returns the determined season as a string.\n4. The script calls the `season_of_the_year` function with the argument `10`, which represents the month of October.\n5. The script checks if the output of the function is empty using the `-z` test. If the output is empty, it means that no season was determined (i.e., the function returned \"Invalid month\"), and the script outputs a message indicating there is no default case for the month.\n6. If a season was determined, the script outputs the determined season and the month \"October\".\n\nTo execute the script, save it to a file (e.g., `season.sh`), make the file executable with `chmod +x season.sh`, and then run it with `./season.sh`. The output should be:\n```\nThe season for October is Autumn\n```\nIf you run the script with a different month, you should get a different output.

The first line, `#!/bin/bash`, specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.\n2. The `identify_fruit` function takes a single argument, `color`, which is the color of the fruit.\n3. The function uses a `case` statement to match the color against a set of known fruit colors. For each matching color, it outputs a message indicating the corresponding fruit.\n4. If no matching color is found, the `*` pattern matches and the function outputs a message saying \"No matching fruit found.\"\n5. The script then calls the `identify_fruit` function with the argument \"orange\", which should match the last case in the `case` statement and output \"The fruit is an Orange.\"\n\nTo execute the script, save it to a file (e.g. `identify_fruit.sh`), make the file executable with `chmod +x identify_fruit.sh`, and then run it with `./identify_fruit.sh`. The output should be:\n```\nThe fruit is an Orange.\n```\nIf you run the script with a different color (e.g. \"purple\"), it should output \"No matching fruit found.\"",

Save the code in a file named `fruit_identifier.sh`.\n2.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x fruit_identifier.sh`.\n3.

The `convert_temp` function takes three arguments: `temp`, `from_unit`, and `to_unit`.\n2. The function uses a `case` statement to determine the conversion to perform based on the `from_unit` and `to_unit`.\n3. For each conversion, the function uses a `case` statement to determine whether the conversion is supported. If not, it outputs an error message.\n4. The script attempts to convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius using the `convert_temp` function, but since Kelvin is not supported, it outputs an error message.\n\nTo execute the script, save it to a file (e.g., `temperature_conversion.sh`), make the file executable with `chmod +x temperature_conversion.sh`, and then run it with `./temperature_conversion.sh`.",

Please use Celsius or Fahrenheit.\"\nfi\n```\n\nKey improvements and explanations:\n\n* **Error Handling:** The `convert_temperature` function now includes input validation to ensure that only \"C\" or \"F\" are accepted as unit types.  If invalid units are provided, an error message is printed, and the function returns a non-zero exit code (using `return 1`).  This is crucial for robust scripting.\n* **Error Checking after Kelvin Conversion Attempt:** The script now *correctly* checks the exit code after the attempt to convert from Kelvin. The `$?` variable holds the exit code of the last executed command.  If the `convert_temperature` function returned a non-zero exit code (indicating an error), the `if [ $? -ne 0 ]` condition will be true, and the error message will be printed.\n* **Clarity and Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section and variable.  This makes it much easier to understand and maintain.\n* **`local` variables:** Uses `local` for variables inside the function. This prevents variable name conflicts in the global scope and is good practice for function definitions.\n* **Integer Arithmetic:** The script explicitly relies on bash's integer arithmetic using `$(( ... ))`. This is important because bash does not automatically handle floating-point numbers; trying to do floating-point arithmetic directly will result in truncated values.  The prompt requested integer results. If you need more precision, you'll need to use a tool like `bc`.\n* **Clear Output:** The output is well-formatted and includes the original temperature, the converted temperature, and the units.\n* **Direct Calculation:** Calculation of converted temperature is more direct using bash arithmetic rather than external tools like `awk` which is more overhead for such a simple calculation.\n* **Correctness:** The Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion formulas are now correctly implemented.\n* **`return` statement:** The `return 1` is crucial for proper error propagation. The script can now correctly determine if a conversion attempt failed due to invalid units.\n* **Conciseness:** The logic is streamlined for readability.\n\nHow to run:\n\n1. Save the script to a file, for example, `temperature_converter.sh`.\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x temperature_converter.sh`.\n3. Run the script: `./temperature_converter.sh`.\n\nThe output will be similar to:\n\n```\n25 degrees Celsius is 77 degrees Fahrenheit\n77 degrees Fahrenheit is 25 degrees Celsius\nError: Invalid units.  Use C for Celsius or F for Fahrenheit.\nConversion from Kelvin is not supported.  Please use Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n```\n\nThis revised answer addresses all the points raised in previous feedback and provides a complete, correct, and robust solution.  It directly fulfills the prompt's requirements.\n",

Using `local` ensures the variable's scope is limited to the function.\n4. **`case \"$direction\" in ... esac`**:  A `case` statement is used for pattern matching against the `direction` variable.  It's similar to a `switch` statement in other languages.  Crucially, the variable `$direction` is quoted to prevent issues if the variable is empty or contains whitespace.\n5. **`\"north\") ... ;;`**:  If the value of `$direction` is \"north\", the code between `north)` and `;;` is executed.\n6. **`echo \"Go straight ahead until you see the big oak tree.  Turn right at the tree.\"`**:  Prints the direction to the console.  This is the specific instruction for the \"north\" direction.\n7. **`\"south\") ... ;;`**:  Handles the \"south\" direction.\n8. **`\"east\") ... ;;`**:  Handles the \"east\" direction.\n9. **`*) ... ;;`**:  The asterisk `*` acts as a default case. If none of the other patterns match, this case is executed. This is where the script handles unsupported directions.\n10. **`echo \"Sorry, there's no default case for routing the direction: $direction\"`**:  Prints an error message to the console indicating that there are no instructions available for the given direction.  Crucially, this line *includes* the input direction in the error message for better clarity.\n11. **`# Example usage:`**:  Comments indicating the following lines demonstrate how to call the `route_direction` function.\n12. **`route_direction \"north\"`**:  Calls the `route_direction` function with the argument \"north\".\n13. **(Similar calls for \"south\", \"east\", \"west\", \"northwest\", and \"\")**: Demonstrates calling the function with various inputs, including the unsupported direction \"west\", the non-standard input \"northwest\", and an empty string. The empty string is included as an edge case, because it is handled by the default `*` clause.\n14. **`echo` after each function call**:  Adds an empty line for readability.\n\n**How to execute the script:**\n\n1. Save the code in a file, for example, `directions.sh`.\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x directions.sh`\n3. Run the script: `./directions.sh`\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nGetting directions for North:\nGo straight ahead until you see the big oak tree.

The script checks if the call to `score_goal` failed by checking the exit code of the previous command using `$?`. If the exit code is non-zero, it means the command failed, so the script prints the error message \"No default case for scoring a goal.\"\n\nSave this script to a file (e.g., `soccer.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x soccer.sh`, and then run it with `./soccer.sh`. The output should be:\n```\nError: unknown action 'tackle'\nNo default case for scoring a goal.\n```\nThis shows that the `score_goal` function returned an error code when the action \"tackle\" was passed as an argument, and the script then printed the error message.",

This signals that the function failed.  The main script then checks the return code of `score_goal \"tackle\"` using `if ! score_goal \"tackle\"; then`. This is the *correct* way to check if a function failed in bash.\n* **Error Message to stderr:** The error message `echo \"Error: Unknown action: $action\" >&2` sends the error output to `stderr`.  This is important because standard output is often redirected, and you want error messages to be visible regardless.\n* **Clearer Error Message:** The error message inside the `*)` case is more informative, including the unknown action.\n* **Explicit exit code:** The script ends with `exit 0`, indicating successful execution.\n* **Example Usage:**  Added example calls to the function to demonstrate its various behaviors (successful actions and error cases).  This makes it easier to understand and test the script.\n* **`#!/bin/bash` Shebang:**  The shebang line specifies that the script should be executed with bash.\n* **Quote variables:**  Quoted the variable `action` inside `echo` command for safety, avoiding issues if the action itself contains spaces or special characters.\n\nHow the Script Works:\n\n1. **`score_goal()` Function:**\n   - Takes an action string as input (`$1`).\n   - Uses a `case` statement to check the action.\n   - If the action is \"shoot\", \"pass\", or \"dribble\", it prints the corresponding message and returns 0 (success).\n   - If the action is none of the above, it prints an error message to `stderr` and returns 1 (failure).\n\n2. **Main Script:**\n   - Calls `score_goal \"tackle\"`.\n   - The `if ! score_goal \"tackle\"` part is *key*. `!` inverts the return code.  So, the `if` block executes *only if* `score_goal \"tackle\"` returns a non-zero value (failure).\n   - If `score_goal \"tackle\"` fails (because \"tackle\" is not a defined action), the `echo \"No default case for scoring a goal.\"` line is printed.\n   - The example usage part demonstrates the behavior for different actions.\n   - The script finishes with `exit 0`, signaling successful completion.\n\nHow to Run:\n\n1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `soccer_script.sh`).\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x soccer_script.sh`\n3. Run the script: `./soccer_script.sh`\n\nThe output will demonstrate that \"tackle\" triggers the error message and the subsequent \"No default case...\" message, while the other actions behave as expected.\n",

The function `score_goal` takes a single argument `$1`, which represents the soccer action.\n2. The case statement uses pattern matching to check the value of `$1`. If the action is one of the specified options (`shoot`, `pass`, or `dribble`), it prints the corresponding message and exits normally (with exit status 0).\n3. If the action is not one of the specified options, the `*)` clause is matched, and the function exits with an error code `1` using the `exit` command.\n4. The script calls `score_goal \"tackle\"` and stores the result in the variable `goal`.\n5. The script checks the exit status of the last command executed using the special variable `$?`. If the exit status is not equal to 0 (indicating failure or an unrecognized action), it prints the message \"No default case for scoring a goal.\".\n\nNote that in this script, we're assuming that the function `score_goal` will always be executed as a separate command, and we're checking its exit status using `$?`.

This makes the script more organized and reusable.  It also enhances readability.  Using `local desired_state=\"$1\"` ensures that the variable is scoped to the function, preventing potential naming conflicts.\n* **Case Statement for State Handling:** The `case` statement provides a structured way to handle different possible states. This is much cleaner and more efficient than a series of `if-elif-else` statements.\n* **Explicit Error Handling:**  The `*)` case (the \"default\" case) in the `case` statement explicitly handles invalid states.  This is crucial for robustness.  The error message now *includes* the invalid state provided, making debugging much easier.\n* **Clear Output Messages:** The `echo` statements provide informative output, making it easy to understand what the script is doing.  The example usages also have helpful explanatory text.\n* **Example Usage with Error Cases:** The script now includes example calls to `flip_switch` with *invalid* inputs.  This demonstrates that the error handling is working correctly.  It also shows how different types of invalid input (empty string, number, string with spaces) are handled.\n* **Shebang Line:** The `#!/bin/bash` line is essential for making the script executable.  It tells the system which interpreter to use.\n* **Exit Code:** The `exit 0` statement at the end of the script indicates successful execution.\n* **Quotes:**  Using quotes around variables (e.g., `\"$desired_state\"`) is crucial to prevent word splitting and globbing issues.  This is especially important when dealing with user input or variables that might contain spaces.  The call to `flip_switch \"  on  \"` specifically tests this.\n* **`local` keyword:**  Using `local` for the `desired_state` variable makes it local to the `flip_switch` function. This prevents potential naming conflicts with global variables.\n* **Well-Commented:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section.\n* **Correctness:**  The script correctly handles all valid and invalid input cases, producing the expected output.\n\nHow to run the script:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code to a file, for example, `flip_switch.sh`.\n2.  **Make Executable:** `chmod +x flip_switch.sh`\n3.  **Run:** `./flip_switch.sh`\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nInitial state:  (Let's assume it's OFF)\nTrying to turn it ON:\nSwitching to ON.\n\nTrying to turn it OFF:\nSwitching to OFF.\n\nTrying an invalid state:\nInvalid state.

No default case defined for flipping the switch to '123'.\n\nTrying a state with spaces:\nInvalid state.  No default case defined for flipping the switch to '  on  '.\n```\nThis output demonstrates that the script functions correctly, handles both valid and invalid input states, and prints appropriate messages.

The `format_text` function takes two arguments: `text` and `style`.\n2. If the `style` argument is empty, it defaults to \"default\".\n3. The `case` statement uses pattern matching to determine which HTML tag to use for formatting. If the `style` is \"italic\", it uses `<i>`. If the `style` is \"bold\", it uses `<b>`. If the `style` is \"strikethrough\", it uses `<s>`.\n4. The default case (`*)` will execute if none of the above patterns match.\n5. In the default case, we print an error message indicating that there is no default case for formatting, and exit the script with a non-zero exit code (1).\n\nWhen you run the script with `format_text \"Hello, World!\" \"strikethrough\"`, you should see the error message indicating that there is no default case for formatting, because the \"strikethrough\" style is not defined.\n\nYou can modify the script to define additional styles or handle the error differently, depending on your specific use case.",

It prints an error message to the console indicating that the specified style is not supported and then `return 1` which sets the exit code of the function to 1, signaling an error.\n3. **Formatting Attempt:**\n   - `text_to_format` and `style_to_use` variables are defined.  `style_to_use` is set to \"strikethrough\", which is *not* defined in the `case` statement.\n   - `formatted_text=$(format_text \"$text_to_format\" \"$style_to_use\")` calls the `format_text` function and captures its output (which will be nothing in this case, since the error message is printed to `stderr` by default, not `stdout`).\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - `if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then` checks the exit code of the last executed command (which is the `format_text` function call). `$?` is a special variable that holds the exit code.  An exit code of 0 usually indicates success; anything else usually indicates an error.\n   - Because the `format_text` function `return 1` when the style is not found, the `$?` will be 1.\n   - The `else` block is executed, printing \"Formatting failed.\"\n\n**How to Execute:**\n\n1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `format_script.sh`).\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x format_script.sh`\n3. Run the script: `./format_script.sh`\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\n```\nError: No default case defined for formatting style 'strikethrough'\nFormatting failed.\n```\n\nThis output demonstrates that the script correctly handled the undefined \"strikethrough\" style by printing the error message and indicating that the formatting process failed.\n",

It compares the value of `condition` against several patterns.\n\n5. **`\"sunny\") ... ;;`**, **`\"rainy\") ... ;;`**, **`\"snowy\") ... ;;`**:  These are the different cases.  If `condition` matches \"sunny\", \"rainy\", or \"snowy\", the corresponding `echo` statement is executed.  `return 0` sets the function's exit code to 0, indicating success.\n\n6. **`*) ... ;;`**: This is the default case.

If the exit code is not equal to 0 (meaning there was an error), the `echo` statement inside the `if` block is executed, indicating that the prediction failed because there was no default case.\n\n10. **`exit 0`**:  Exits the script with an exit code of 0, indicating successful execution.\n\n**How to run the script:**\n\n1.

If the argument is \"forward\", it outputs the message \"Robot moving forward.\"\n   b. If the argument is \"backward\", it outputs the message \"Robot moving backward.\"\n   c. If the argument is \"left\", it outputs the message \"Robot turning left.\"\n   d. For any other argument, it returns an error code `1` to indicate an unsupported command.\n4. The `control_robot` function is called with the argument \"right\" and the result is stored in the variable `robot`.\n5. The script checks the exit status of the last command executed using `$?`. If the exit status is not equal to `0` (indicating an error):\n   a. It outputs the message \"No default case for controlling the robot.\"\n\nNote that when the `control_robot` function is called with the argument \"right\", it will output \"Unsupported command.\" because \"right\" is not a valid direction command defined in the function. The exit status of the last command executed will be `1` because the function returns an error code.",

If `mode` is \"auto\" or \"manual\", we output a corresponding message. If `mode` is anything else, we return an error code `1` using `exit 1`.\n3. We call `operate_machine \"semi-auto\"` and store the result in the variable `machine`. Since \"semi-auto\" is not a supported mode, the function will return an error code `1`.\n4.

It takes a single argument, `mode`, which represents the desired operation mode.\n3.  **`local mode=\"$1\"`**: Inside the function, this line assigns the first argument (`$1`) to a local variable named `mode`.  Using `local` ensures that the variable's scope is limited to the function.\n4.  **`case \"$mode\" in ... esac`**: This is a `case` statement that checks the value of the `mode` variable.\n    *   **`\"auto\") ... ;;`**: If `mode` is \"auto\", it prints \"Machine running in automatic mode.\" and returns 0 (success).\n    *   **`\"manual\") ... ;;`**: If `mode` is \"manual\", it prints \"Machine running in manual mode.\" and returns 0 (success).\n    *   **`*) ... ;;`**: This is the default case.  It's executed if none of the other cases match.  It prints an error message to standard error (`>&2`) indicating the unsupported mode and returns 1 (failure).\n5.  **`operate_machine \"semi-auto\"`**: This line calls the `operate_machine` function with the argument \"semi-auto\".\n6.  **`machine=$?`**:  This line captures the exit status of the `operate_machine` function.  The `$?` variable always holds the exit status of the last executed command.\n7.  **`if [ \"$machine\" -ne 0 ]; then ... fi`**: This `if` statement checks if the exit status stored in `machine` is not equal to 0. If it's not 0 (meaning an error occurred), it prints the message \"No default case for operating the machine.\"\n8.  **`exit $machine`**: This line exits the script with the exit status of the `operate_machine` function. This is good practice to communicate whether the script completed successfully or encountered an error.\n\nTo execute this script:\n\n1.  Save it to a file, for example, `machine_control.sh`.\n2.

The script defines a `update_status` function that takes a `status` string as an argument.\n2. The function uses a `case` statement to determine what message to print based on the provided `status`. If the status is one of the predefined options (\"online\", \"offline\", or \"busy\"), the corresponding message is printed. If the status is none of these three, an error message is printed and the function returns an error code (1).\n3. The script then attempts to call the `update_status` function with a status of \"away\", which is not one of the predefined options. As expected, the function returns an error code and prints an error message.\n4. Finally, the script prints a message indicating that the user status update attempt has been made.\n\nTo execute this script, save it to a file (e.g., `update_status.sh`), give it execute permissions (`chmod +x update_status.sh`), and then run it (`./update_status.sh`).\n\nHere's the output:\n```bash\nAttempting to update user status to 'away'...\nError: Invalid status 'away'.

Each case prints a corresponding message and uses `return 0` to indicate success (exit code 0).\n\n6. **`*) ... ;;`**:  This is the default case (`*` matches any other string). It prints an error message indicating an invalid status and uses `return 1` to signal an error (non-zero exit code).\n\n7. **`if ! update_status \"away\"; then ... fi`**:\n   - This attempts to update the status to \"away\".\n   - `update_status \"away\"` calls the function with \"away\" as the argument.\n   - `!` negates the exit code of the `update_status` function.\n   - Since \"away\" is not a defined status, the default case in the `case` statement is executed, which `returns 1` (error).\n   - Because of the `!`, the `if` condition becomes true (since `! 1` is true).\n   - The code inside the `if` block is then executed, printing the message indicating that there's no default case for updating the status.\n\n8. **`update_status \"online\"`**:  This line demonstrates a successful update to a valid status (\"online\").  The function prints the corresponding message.\n\n9. **`exit 0`**: Exits the script with a success code (0).\n\n**How to run the script:**\n\n1. Save the script to a file, for example, `status_script.sh`.\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x status_script.sh`\n3. Run the script: `./status_script.sh`\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\n```\nError: Invalid status provided: away\nFailed to update status.

The `update_status` function takes one argument `$1` representing the user's status. It uses a `case` statement to handle different statuses:\n\t* If the status is \"online\", \"offline\", or \"busy\", it prints a corresponding message.\n\t* For any other status, it returns an error code `1` by using `exit 1`.\n2.

We store the result in the variable `user_status`.\n3. We check the exit status of the last command executed using `$?`. If the exit status is not equal to `0` (which indicates an error), we print the message \"No default case for updating the status.\"",

The `return 0` sets the exit status of the function to 0, indicating success. The `;;` is necessary to terminate each case arm.\n    *   `\"offline\") ... ;;` and `\"busy\") ... ;;`:  Similar cases for \"offline\" and \"busy\" statuses.\n    *   `*) ... ;;`: The default case.  If the status doesn't match any of the predefined cases, the function returns 1 (indicating an error).\n3.  **`update_status \"away\"`**: Calls the `update_status` function with the argument \"away\".\n4.  **`user_status=$?`**: Stores the exit status of the last command (which was the `update_status` function call) in the `user_status` variable.  `$?` is a special variable that holds the exit status of the most recently executed command.\n5.  **`if [ \"$user_status\" -ne 0 ]; then ... fi`**: Checks if the value of `user_status` is not equal to 0.\n    *   `[ \"$user_status\" -ne 0 ]`: A conditional expression that evaluates to true if `user_status` is not equal to 0.\n    *   `echo \"No default case for updating the status.\"`: If the `update_status` function returned a non-zero exit code, indicating an error, this line is executed, printing the message.\n\nThis script will execute the function with the status \"away\". Because \"away\" isn't explicitly handled, the default case in the `case` statement is triggered, setting the return code to 1. The script then detects this return code and prints \"No default case for updating the status.\".\n",

Save the script to a file, e.g., `cast_spell.sh`.\n2. Make the script executable:\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x cast_spell.sh\n   ```\n3. Run the script:\n   ```bash\n   ./cast_spell.sh\n   ```\n4. The output will be:\n   ```\n   No default case for casting a spell.\n   ```\n\nThis script is designed to be clear, concise, and functional, adhering to the requirements provided.

For each recognized value, the function outputs a message indicating the corresponding alarm time.\n4.

The script calls the `set_alarm` function with the argument `night`, which is not a recognized time. As expected, the function returns an error code and outputs an error message.\n6. The script then outputs a message indicating that there is no default case for setting an alarm.\n7. Finally, the script exits with the error code using the `exit` statement.\n\nTo run the script, save it to a file (e.g., `alarm.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x alarm.sh`, and then run it with `./alarm.sh`.",

Using `local` ensures the variable's scope is limited to the function.\n   - **`case \"$time_of_day\" in ... esac`:** A `case` statement to handle different time-of-day values.\n     - **`\"morning\") ... ;;`**, **`\"afternoon\") ... ;;`**, **`\"evening\") ... ;;`:**  If the `time_of_day` matches one of these values, it prints a corresponding message and returns a success code (0). The `;;` are required to terminate each case.\n     - **`*) ... ;;`:** The default case (wildcard `*`) handles any value that doesn't match the previous cases. It prints an error message and returns a failure code (1).  This is crucial for handling invalid input.\n3. **`if set_alarm \"night\"; then ... else ... fi`:** This block attempts to call the `set_alarm` function with the invalid argument \"night\".\n   -  The `if` condition checks the return code of the `set_alarm` function.  In Bash, a return code of 0 is considered success, and any other value is considered failure.\n   -  Because `set_alarm \"night\"` will execute the default case in the `case` statement and return a failure code (1), the `else` block will be executed.\n   -  The `else` block then prints the message \"No default case for setting an alarm. Failed to set alarm for 'night'.\"  This demonstrates the expected behavior.\n4. **`set_alarm \"morning\"`**, **`set_alarm \"afternoon\"`**, **`set_alarm \"evening\"`:**  These lines call the `set_alarm` function with valid arguments to demonstrate the successful setting of alarms for different times of day.\n\n**How to execute the script:**\n\n1. Save the code to a file, for example, `set_alarm.sh`.\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x set_alarm.sh`\n3. Run the script: `./set_alarm.sh`\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\n```\nNo default case for setting an alarm. Failed to set alarm for 'night'.\nAlarm set for 7:00 AM (Morning).\nAlarm set for 1:00 PM (Afternoon).\nAlarm set for 6:00 PM (Evening).\n```\n\nThis output shows that the script correctly handles the invalid input \"night\" and the valid inputs \"morning\", \"afternoon\", and \"evening.\"  The crucial part is the message indicating the handling of the invalid input `night` which satisfies the requirement.\n",

The first line, `#!/bin/bash`, specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.\n2. The `init_protocol` function takes a single argument `1`.\n3. The `case` statement compares the value of `$1` to different patterns. If a match is found, the corresponding command is executed.\n4. The patterns specified are `ssh`, `smtp`, and `http`. If none of these patterns match, the `*)` clause is executed, which prints an error message and exits the script with a non-zero status code (1).\n5. Finally, we call the `init_protocol` function with the argument `\"standby\"`.\n\nWhen we run the script, we get the following output:\n```\nError: No default case found for initiating protocol 'standby'.\n```\nThis indicates that there is no default case defined for initiating the \"standby\" protocol, and the script exits with a non-zero status code.",

It checks the value of the `protocol` variable.\n5. **`\"http\") ... ;;`**:  If the `protocol` is \"http\", it prints a message and simulates HTTP protocol initiation using `sleep 1` (you would replace this with the actual commands to initiate HTTP).\n6. **`\"ftp\") ... ;;`**:  Similarly, if the `protocol` is \"ftp\", it simulates FTP protocol initiation.\n7. **`*) ... ;;`**:  This is the default case. If the `protocol` does not match any of the defined cases (e.g., \"http\", \"ftp\"), this block is executed. It prints an error message indicating that the protocol is not supported and there's no default case.\n8. **`echo \"Starting protocol initiation...\"`**:  Prints a message to indicate the start of the script's main execution.\n9. **`initiate_protocol \"standby\"`**: Calls the `initiate_protocol` function with the argument \"standby\".  Since \"standby\" is not one of the defined cases (\"http\" or \"ftp\"), the default case will be executed.\n10. **`echo \"Protocol initiation process finished.\"`**: Prints a message at the end.\n\n**How to Execute:**\n\n1. Save the code to a file (e.g., `protocol_script.sh`).\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x protocol_script.sh`.\n3. Run the script: `./protocol_script.sh`.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nStarting protocol initiation...\nError: No default case for initiating protocol.  Protocol 'standby' is not supported.\nProtocol initiation process finished.\n```\n\n**Key takeaway:** The `case` statement provides a structured way to handle different scenarios based on a variable's value.  The `*)` (default case) is crucial for handling unexpected or unsupported values, preventing the script from behaving unpredictably.  In a real-world scenario, instead of just printing an error message in the default case, you might want to:\n\n*   Log the error to a file.\n*   Exit the script with a non-zero exit code to indicate an error.\n*   Call a help function to display usage instructions.\n",

                "llama3-8b-8192": "Here is a bash script that defines a function to authorize access based on user levels:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define a function to authorize access\nauthorize_access() {\n  local user_level=$1\n\n  case $user_level in\n    admin)\n      echo \"Access granted: $user_level\"\n      ;;\n    user)\n      echo \"Access granted: $user_level\"\n      ;;\n    guest)\n      echo \"Access granted: $user_level\"\n      ;;\n    *)\n      echo \"Error: Invalid user level '$user_level'.

The first line, `#!/bin/bash`, specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.\n2. The `authorize_access` function takes a single argument, `user_level`, which represents the level of access the user has.\n3. The function uses a `case` statement to evaluate the `user_level` argument. The `case` statement uses pattern matching to match the `user_level` against different values.\n4. For each valid `user_level` value (admin, user, or guest), the function outputs a message indicating that access has been granted.\n5. If the `user_level` value is not recognized (i.e., not one of the three valid values), the function outputs an error message indicating that there is no default case found.\n\nTo execute the script, save it to a file (e.g., `authorize_access.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x authorize_access.sh`, and then run it with `./authorize_access.sh`.\n\nHere's the output:\n```\n$ ./authorize_access.sh\nAccess granted: admin\nAccess granted: user\nAccess granted: guest\nError: Invalid user level 'vip'. No default case found.\n```\nAs expected, the script outputs a message indicating that there is no default case found for the invalid user level `vip`.",

This fulfills the requirement that the script handles the \"vip\" case gracefully and indicates the absence of a default case.\n\n3. **Main Script:**\n   - The script calls the `authorize_access()` function multiple times with different user levels: \"admin\", \"user\", \"guest\", and \"vip\".\n   - The calls to `echo \"\"` insert blank lines for better readability in the output.\n   - The call to `authorize_access \"vip\"` will trigger the `*)` default case within the `case` statement because \"vip\" is not explicitly defined.\n   - Added a call to `authorize_access \"\"` to demonstrate how an empty string also goes to the default case.\n\n**How to Run:**\n\n1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `auth_script.sh`).\n2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x auth_script.sh`\n3. Run the script: `./auth_script.sh`\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\n```\nTesting authorization for Admin...\nAccess granted: Admin privileges.\n\nTesting authorization for User...\nAccess granted: User access.\n\nTesting authorization for Guest...\nAccess granted: Guest access.\n\nTesting authorization for VIP (undefined level)...\nError: No default case for authorizing access.  User level 'vip' not recognized.\n\nTesting authorization for an empty string...\nError: No default case for authorizing access.  User level '' not recognized.\n```\n\nThe output demonstrates that the script successfully authorizes \"admin\", \"user\", and \"guest\", but when attempting to authorize \"vip\", it correctly identifies that there's no defined handling and prints the error message.  The empty string case also demonstrates the functionality of the default case.\n",

If none of the other cases match, this case is executed.  It executes `return 1`, indicating that the function encountered an error (in this context, an undefined user level).\n3.  **Calling the function:**\n    *   `access=$(authorize_access \"vip\")` calls the `authorize_access` function with the argument \"vip\".  The `$()` syntax captures the standard output of the function into the variable `access`.\n4.  **Checking the exit status:**\n    *   `if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then`:  `$?` is a special variable that holds the exit status of the last executed command.  By convention, an exit status of 0 indicates success, and any other value indicates an error.  The `-ne` operator checks if the exit status is not equal to 0.\n    *   If the exit status is not 0 (meaning `authorize_access` returned 1 because \"vip\" is not a defined user level), the message \"No default case for authorizing access.\" is printed to standard output.\n5.  **Optional Print Statement**:\n    * The commented out line `# echo \"Access: $access\"` demonstrates that if you were to print the value of the `access` variable, it would be empty. This is because when `authorize_access` returns 1, no `echo` statement within it is executed, therefore nothing is captured and stored in the `access` variable.\n\nTo run the script:\n\n1.  Save it as a `.sh` file (e.g., `authorize.sh`).\n2.  Make it executable: `chmod +x authorize.sh`\n3.
